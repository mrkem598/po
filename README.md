# portfolio-site

This is the code for my portfolio site, which is live at www.adamcamacho.com.

Note that the deployed site works well, but the version displayed on htmlpreview.github.io does not show the text typed on the home page on page load and it also does not show the modal that opens up when contact is selected in the navigation bar.

Correction, it looks like both those features function now on htmlpreview.github.io.  I changed nothing.
